                <h2 class="section-heading">What is procrastination?</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the years, humans have achieved enormous advances in all fields of science. These cutting-edge innovations didn’t come at a low price; scientists had to sacrifice many things, including their health and social life.</p>
                    <p>The world, as we know today, would not exist if not for the incredible determination, innovation, and creative thinking of academics and researchers.</p>
                    <p>However, there is one enemy that’s always lurking in the dark to stop every attempt to create something unique. An enemy that’s constantly stopping you from completing the task/goal that you’ve been thinking about for weeks.</p>
                    <h5>It’s procrastination!</h5>
                    <p><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-psychology-of-procrastination-2795944">Studies estimate that 25-75% of college students procrastinate</a> on academic work, which is a staggering number!</p>
                    <p>Note that procrastination is not limited to the academic field, as many athletes deal with this problem, especially when training for an upcoming competition.</p>
                    <p>In this article, we will discuss the neuroscience behind procrastination, as well as the three major tips that will help you get rid of this habit.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">The neuroscience of procrastination</h2>
                    <p>Over the past few decades, many scientific papers supported the theory that we do not have full control over our conscious mind –at least not in a conventional way–.</p>
                    <p>These studies involved experimenting on the brain, using electrodes to study electrical activity, neuroimaging, and brain-stimulation techniques.</p>
                    <p>The goal of these experiments was to observe if there is any activity in the brain before making a conscious decision.</p>
                    <p>Discussing these experiments in detail would be out of the scope of this article; however, we can add our contribution to this pile of evidence.</p>
                    <h5>Here’s an example:</h5>
                    <p>You wake in the morning and set your mind to perform a certain task. At the end of the day, you’ll realize that you did many things during the day except for that one particular task that was a priority for you.</p>
                    <h5>This suggests that there’s something else in control of our decisions –an unconscious brain–.</h5>
                <h2 class="section-heading">The prefrontal cortex role in executive functions</h2>
                    <p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) seems to be in control of the intentional and planned behavior, but in order to understand the effect of this brain region on procrastination, we need to remove it from a living human being, which is unreasonable.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1114479/">famous case of Phineas Gage (1823-1860)</a> allowed scientists to study the effect of the PFC on many behavioral functions.</p>
                    <p>Phineas Gage was a railroad constructor who had an accident when he was 25 years old. While working with dynamites, a long metal rod penetrated Gage’s skull, destroying his PFC.</p>
                    <p>Miraculously, Gage survived and went back to his normal life after a few weeks of the accident.</p>
                    <p>However, Gage had extreme behavioral changes, as he became more compulsive and lost his self-control. He also became super lazy and unable to create a long-term plan.</p>
                    <p>According to our knowledge, Gage was the first human that depicted the relationship between the PFC and procrastination.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Role of PFC in procrastination</h2>
                    <p>In short, PFC is responsible for planning long-term goals and putting in the effort to achieve those goals.</p>
                    <p>Scientists later discovered that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018960/">PFC is not the exclusive system that regulates this process</a>, but it is still the major player.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">What are the causes of procrastination?</h2>
                    <p>There are many factors that may drive a person to avoid working on an important project and spend their time doing other activities.</p>
                    <p>Here’s a shortlist of the most common causes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lack of motivation</li>
                        <li>Low self-esteem and self-confidence</li>
                        <li>Fear of failure</li>
                        <li>Having trouble understanding the nature of the project</li>
                        <li>Distractibility and inability to concentrate</li>
                        <li>Perfectionism</li>
                        <li>Fatigue (low energy)</li>
                        <li>Poor organization skills</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These factors seem to interact with the brain regions cited above to deviate you from doing the one thing you must do.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">3 simple tips to stop procrastination</h2>
                    <h5>Do nothing!</h5>
                    <p>This tip might seem counterintuitive at first; however, there is some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125391/">scientific evidence</a> that doing nothing for 20-30 minutes can significantly reduce procrastination.</p>
                    <p>The idea behind this tip is that when people procrastinate, they tend to do other non-essential activities, such as cleaning the house twice or binge-watch a TV series.</p>
                    <p>What you won’t see a procrastinator do, however, is to sit and do nothing.</p>
                    <p>During those 30 minutes, you should plan the steps to take in order to complete the task, and once the time is up, get going.</p>
                    <h5>Divide the work into small parts</h5>
                    <p>The human brain is designed to respond to quick, immediately rewarding tasks.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25720819">nucleus accumbens</a> (pleasure center) inside the brain is activated when you’re indulging in a pleasurable activity, such as eating, drinking, and watching your favorite show.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if you have a long-term goal, your brain tries to slow things down to make you quit the project since no activation of the nucleus accumbens is happening.</p>
                    <p>To counter this phenomenon, try to divide the work into small pieces that are easily achievable.</p>
                    <p><b>Do not underestimate the power of crossing a task off your checklist.</b></p>
                    <h5>Think of the bigger picture</h5>
                    <p>While it is important to keep working on your goal, you should always remember the bigger picture; appreciate what you already have, enjoy your time with family, and be grateful.</p>
                    <p>When goal-related anxiety tampers down, procrastination follows.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>There are many obstacles that face people when they try to achieve a long-term goal.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully, you are now more familiar with the neuroscience of procrastination, as well as the scientific methods you can use to reduce this counterproductive phenomenon.</p>
